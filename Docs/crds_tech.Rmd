## Review of stable water isotopes

Testing of LaTex math equations

$$
\delta = \left[ \frac{R_{sample}}{R_{standard}} - 1 \right]
$$

$$
\delta D = 8\delta^{18}O + 10 \:^0\!\!/\!_{00} 
$$

## How CRDS works {.columns-2}

- Tunable laser (controlled by wavelength monitor)
  - Tuned to absorption spectra of target species
- Laser circulates in cavity (~20 km pathlength)
- Laser shuts off and laser light leaks out (ring down)
  - Partially transparent mirror to photo dector
  - Rate of intesnity decay proportional to concentration of interested species
- Permits detection sensitivity up to parts-per-billion

## Sample preparation

## Vial preparation

- Minimize headspace
- Ensure no cross-contamination between samples
- Ensure proper fit/closure of vial caps

## Isotope standards

- Minimize ambient exposure
- Ensure tight seal with parafilm after replacing lid

## Tray template



## Operating procedures

**Do not attempt to operate the Picarro without either the lab manager or Dr. Rupper present!**

You will primarily use two applications when measuring and recording isotope data: the "Autosampler Control" and the "Coordinator Launcher"
- The first tells the Picarro where the samples are, how many injections to perform, etc.
- The second controls the measurement and recording the data analysis

The next few slides walk through the process of setting up and running isotope analyses

*Note: These instructions assume the instrument is already properly booted, with the CRDS Data Viewer open and actively measuring values. 
If this is not the case, see the lab manager or Dr. Rupper for assistance.*

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.cap= "", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Opening-screen.PNG")
```

## 1. Launch the "Autosampler Control" application

```{r, out.width = "95%", fig.cap= "", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Opening-screen.PNG")
```

---

This launches the following window

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.cap= "", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/autosampler.PNG")
```

## 2. Configure the sample/injection layout

- The layout will be based on your previously-completed tray template
- Use the "DGK_norm" method for all injections
- Standards should have 10 injections per vial
- Samples and QCs should have 5 injections per vial
- Remember that port numbers and sample numbers are usually not the same thing
- Make sure the box is checked for each line you wish to actually run

## 3. Launch the "Coordinator Launcher" application

```{r, out.width = "75%", fig.cap= "", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/autosampler.PNG")
```

Prior to launching the Coordinator, ensure that the "Autosampler Control" window is still open

## {.columns-2}

- The Coordinator has 3 possible modes of operation: "High precision", "high throughput", and "manual injections"
  - High precision is...more precise
  - High throughput is faster (takes ~4 minutes per injection compared to HP's 9 minutes)
  - Manual injections does not use the autosampler (you likely will never use this mode)
- Select a mode and click "Launch"

```{r, out.width = "95%", fig.cap= "", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/coordinator-select.PNG")
```

---

The below window should then launch, with updating information on the current state of analysis

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.cap= "", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/coordinator.PNG")
```

---

Also note the filename at the top of the window. 
Feel free to either keep the assigned default or change it to something else. 
Just make sure you know what it is so you can find it later to copy the completed data.

## 4. Start your isotope run

- Return to the "Autosampler Control" window and press the "Run" button
  - This will start the analysis (once the Coordinator has completed its initial start-up procedures)

```{r, out.width = "85%", fig.cap= "", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/coordinator.PNG")
```
